#Logistics Data Processing with Kafka and MongoDB
##Introduction
This project involves the development of a Python-based application that integrates Kafka and MongoDB to process logistics data. The application consists of a Kafka producer and consumer, data serialization/deserialization with Avro, and data ingestion into MongoDB. Additionally, an API has been developed to interact with the data stored in MongoDB Atlas.

##Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

Basic understanding of Python, Kafka, MongoDB, and Docker.
Access to Confluent Kafka and MongoDB Atlas.
Familiarity with Docker and containerization.
##Getting Started
Follow the steps below to set up and run the project:

###Kafka Producer
Develop a Python script to act as a Kafka producer.
Use Pandas to read logistics data from a CSV file.
Serialize the data into Avro format and publish it to a Confluent Kafka topic.
###Schema Registry Integration
Establish a Schema Registry for managing Avro schemas.
Ensure that the Kafka producer and consumer fetch the schema from the Schema Registry during serialization and deserialization.
###Kafka Consumer
Write a Python script for the Kafka consumer.
Deserialize the Avro data and ingest it into a MongoDB collection.
###Scaling Kafka Consumers with Docker
Utilize Docker to scale Kafka consumers.
Provide instructions for deploying multiple instances of the Kafka consumer using Docker.
###Data Validation
Implement data validation checks in the consumer script before ingesting data into MongoDB. Validations include checking for null values, data type validation, and format checks.

###API Development using MongoDB Atlas
Create an API to interact with the MongoDB collection.
Implement endpoints for filtering specific JSON documents and for aggregating data.
